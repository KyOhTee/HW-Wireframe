            Hey everyone! I'm Kyle (Holmes), one of the three Kyles in our class.<br>
            I was born in Detroit, but moved to Colorado before my seocnd birthday.<br>
            After high school, I worked in various trade-style jobs before returning to<br>
            academia. I attended Metropolitan State University where I initially planned<br>
            on becoming an English teacher before discovering my calling in the field of<br>
            Addiction and Domestic counseling. During my free-time, I love drawing,running,<br>
            and riding my bike around the city spending time with my English Bulldog, Louise.
